# Adaptive Subterranean Robotic Hexapod Simulation

Our software simulated hexapod will attempt to reach a goal point on a virtual 3D map.
We are using terrain mapping and recognition tactics to drive the robot while we improve upon a base walking algorithm with a learning techinique. 

### Prerequisites
* [Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/installation-procedure) (most recent installation)

## Walking
The robot starts with a base walking algorithm that utilizes sinusoidal patterns to walk forwards and backwards, as well as turning clockwise and counter-clockwise. This walking is improved upon over time automatically as the robot tries different things in an attempt to traverse the map faster.

Below is an example of how we get our robot to walk with the press of the UP arrow key: 
```c
/* 
> a is an array of amplitudes  (will be altered in learning approach)
> M_PI is the value of pi
> f is the frequency (usually between .5 and 1)
> time is time
> p is an array of offset values Î¦ (will be altered in learning approach)
> d is an array of physical offset values
*/
if(key == WB_KEYBOARD_UP)
    for (i = 0; i < 18; ++i)  // Apply a sinuosidal function for each motor.
        wb_motor_set_position(Hexabot_Motors[i], a[i] * sin(2.0 * M_PI * f * time + p[i]) + d[i]);
```
