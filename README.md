# Adaptive Subterranean Robotic Hexapod Simulation

Our software simulated hexapod will attempt to reach a goal point on a virtual 3D map.
We are using terrain mapping and recognition tactics to improve upon a base walking algorithm. 

### Prerequisites
*Webots (most recent installation)
*blender (release 2.79) (for creating models)
